# Hello_World
supreme potato

Personally, I don't even know why github is called "github" sicne it mostly has to do with coding and project management...
I mean, is it a hub for gits? And, in which case, what exactly is a git?
according to google:
git
É¡it/
nounBritishinformal
noun: git; plural noun: gits

    an unpleasant or contemptible person.

Ah, so it's British!
That's why I don't know what it means...
So does that mean that github is a hub for unpleasant people?
If so, then does that make me unpleasant for making an account and actively participating in this tutorial session?
I don't think I am, but maybe it's one of those things where because I don't think I'm unpleasant I actually am truly unpleasant...
besides, wouldn't calling your userbase unpleasant be, like, a very bad merketing strategy or something?
I mean, imagine if to promote github it just called everyone that used it a bunch of assholes...

anyway

I don't really know what's going on anymore, it's like 2 in the morning and I've been listening to Persona 5 music for the past 15 minutes.

It's not like anyone's ever going to look at this message anyway.
